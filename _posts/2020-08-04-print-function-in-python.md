Hey! Welcome to your first lesson on python at Vinayak D Knight - Coding
In this first lesson you will be writing the code that all the greatest developers have written in their first lesson. The Hello World code.
```python
print("Hello World")
```
<p style="background:green">This is a paragraph written in html with green background</p>

It is said that if you can write "Hello World", you can even change the world.
